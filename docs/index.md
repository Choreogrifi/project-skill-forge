# skill-forge

A filesystem-based skill management system for LLMs.

Skills are directories. State is encoded in the directory name. Symlinks control which skills are visible to Claude, Gemini, and other LLM agents — no database, no background services.

## Install

**Homebrew (macOS / Linux)**

```bash
brew tap choreogrifi/skill-forge
brew install skill-forge
```

**curl one-liner**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Choreogrifi/skill-forge/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**From source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Choreogrifi/skill-forge.git
cd skill-forge
bash scripts/install.sh
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# List all skills and their states
agents ls

# Activate a skill (makes it visible to LLMs)
agents activate architect

# Check symlink health
agents status

# Run a full audit and auto-fix violations
agents audit

# Self-check the environment
agents doctor
```
