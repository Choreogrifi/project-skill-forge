# Video Content Subflow

Guides the user through planning and scripting video content — from concept to shot list.
Covers short-form (Reels, Shorts, TikTok) and long-form (YouTube, course content) formats.

## Equipment Context

This subflow is aware of common consumer/prosumer equipment. If the user specifies their kit,
tailor recommendations accordingly. Known reference kit:

| Equipment | Notes |
|---|---|
| iPhone 15 | 4K/60fps, ProRes on Pro models; excellent stabilisation; great for run-and-gun |
| Canon EOS R6 Mark II | Full-frame mirrorless; exceptional in low light; ideal for cinematic talking-head |
| MacBook Pro M1 | Final Cut Pro or DaVinci Resolve work excellently; ProRes editing native |

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Video Details

Ask the user:

```
Video details:
  Topic and key message:
  Format: short-form (<60s) / medium (1–5 min) / long-form (5–20 min+)
  Platform: YouTube / Instagram Reels / TikTok / LinkedIn / course / other
  Audience:
  Talking-head, screen recording, voiceover, or mixed?
  Equipment available (camera, mic, lighting):
  Do you need: script / shot list / both?
```

### 2. Script (if requested)

Structure the script based on format:

**Short-form (<60s):**
```
[0–3s]  Hook — attention-grabbing opening
[3–45s] Value — the core message or demonstration
[45–60s] CTA — call to action
```

**Long-form:**
```
[Intro]     Hook + what the viewer will learn
[Section 1] Core content point 1
[Section 2] Core content point 2
[Section 3] Core content point 3 (or demonstration)
[Outro]     Summary + subscribe CTA + next video teaser
```

Present the full script for approval before finalising.

### 3. Shot List (if requested)

Produce a numbered shot list:

```
Shot list: <video title>
──────────────────────────────────────
#  | Type           | Description                    | Notes
---|----------------|--------------------------------|--------------
1  | Wide / Establish| Opening shot of <subject>     | Tripod, natural light
2  | Talking head   | Intro monologue                | Eye-level, Canon R6
3  | B-roll         | Screen recording of <X>        | MacBook, QuickTime
4  | Close-up       | Product detail                 | iPhone macro mode
...
```

### 4. Production Notes (optional)

If the user wants equipment-specific guidance, provide:

**iPhone 15:**
- Shoot in 4K/24fps for cinematic look; 4K/60fps for slow-motion b-roll
- Use Cinematic Mode for shallow depth of field on subjects
- External lav mic (e.g. DJI Mic) improves audio significantly
- Lock exposure and focus by long-pressing the subject

**Canon R6 Mark II:**
- C-Log 3 for maximum dynamic range — grade in DaVinci Resolve
- RF 50mm f/1.8 or RF 35mm f/1.8 for talking-head; RF 15-35mm for b-roll
- Enable in-body stabilisation; use a Joby or tripod for static shots
- External monitor or phone as monitor via HDMI for solo shooting

**MacBook Pro M1 (editing):**
- Final Cut Pro: best ProRes performance; fast export
- DaVinci Resolve: superior colour grading; free version sufficient for most work
- Handbrake for final compression to H.264/H.265 for upload

### 5. Approval and Output

Present all components (script, shot list, production notes) for a single approval.
On approval, output each as a separate clearly labelled section ready to save or print.

## Guidelines

- Scripts are guides, not teleprompters — encourage the user to speak naturally from bullet points rather than reading word-for-word.
- Shot lists should be practical — if the user is filming solo, suggest self-shooting techniques.
- Never suggest equipment the user has not confirmed they own or have access to.
