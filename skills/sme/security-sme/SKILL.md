# Security Expertise
- **Standards**: Follow OWASP Top 10 and Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).
- **Mandatory Tasks**:
    1. Flag hardcoded secrets or credential files immediately.
    2. Review IAM / RBAC roles for Least Privilege compliance.
    3. Ensure encryption-at-rest via platform KMS or equivalent for sensitive data stores.
- **Constraints**: Critical block on any code proposing overly broad roles (e.g., owner/admin at resource root).
- **Environment Workflows**: Security automation is environment-specific. Create `security-<env>-wf` workflow skills (e.g., `security-gcp-wf`, `security-aws-wf`) for platform-specific security operations. Use `skillforge customize` to scaffold them. Named correctly, they are auto-discovered by `skillforge audit`.
- **References**: Environment-specific security workflows are user-created. Name them `security-<env>-wf` (e.g., `security-gcp-wf`, `security-aws-wf`) so they are auto-discovered by `skillforge audit`. Use `skillforge customize` to scaffold them.

## Activation Context

Invoked as a supporting advisor by `architect-sme` and `engineer-sme` when a design or implementation decision has security implications. May also be invoked directly for dedicated security reviews.
